		<h1>Snowboarding</h1>
			<p><strong>Snowboarding</strong> is a recreational activity and <strong>Olympic</strong> and <strong>Paralympic</strong> sport that involves descending a snow-covered slope while standing on a snowboard attached to a rider's feet. The development of snowboarding was inspired by <em>skateboarding</em>, <em>sledding</em>, <em>surfing</em> and <em>skiing</em>. It was developed in the United States in the 1960s, became a Winter Olympic Sport at Nagano in 1998 and first featured in the Winter Paralympics at Sochi in 2014.</p>
		<h2>Skateboarding</h2>
			<p><strong>Skateboarding</strong> is an action sport which involves riding and performing tricks using a skateboard, as well as a recreational activity, an art form, an entertainment industry job, and a method of transportation. Skateboarding has been shaped and influenced by many skateboarders throughout the years. A 2009 report found that the skateboarding market is worth an estimated $4.8 billion in annual revenue with 11.08 million active skateboarders in the world. In 2016, it was announced that skateboarding will be represented at the <strong>2020 Summer Olympics</strong> in Tokyo. Since the 1970s, skateparks have been constructed specifically for use by <em>skateboarders</em>, <em>Freestyle BMXers</em>, <em>aggressive skaters</em>, and very recently, <em>scooters</em>. However, skateboarding has become controversial in areas in which the activity, although legal, has damaged curbs, stoneworks, steps, benches, plazas and parks.</p>
